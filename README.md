🍽️ Food Trends Understanding Customer Preference in Food and Beverage 

📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer food preferences and dietary habits using Power BI. The main objective is to uncover insights into how lifestyle factors, diet types, pricing, and nutrition influence food choices and health outcomes.
The dataset includes diverse attributes such as age, gender, activity level, dietary preference, calorie intake, nutrients (protein, fat, fiber, sugar, sodium), diseases, price, and ratings.
By leveraging Power BI’s data visualization and analytical capabilities, the project provides interactive dashboards that highlight patterns, correlations, and trends in dietary behavior and nutritional balance.
